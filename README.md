## Purpose of Contract
To ensure that inventory/products are kept track of before production and distribution to consumers and retailers (from suppliers to the manufacturers), it is important that everything is kept inventory of and that products are produced and passed off to each supply chain body in a timely manner. Consequently, the focus of this smart contract is to secure this portion of the supply chain cycle. In this, we have suppliers and manufacturers.

In short, this contract is in the realm of supply chain smart contracts, but it will be limited to the relationship between suppliers that are delivering and charging for certain products and manufacturers that will be paying for the shipments and keeping track of their own inventory.
