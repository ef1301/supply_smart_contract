## Purpose of Contract
To ensure that inventory/products are kept track of before distribution to consumers and retailers (from manufacturers to retailers), it is important that everything is kept inventory of and that products are produced and passed off to each supply chain body in a timely manner. Consequently, the focus of this smart contract is to secure this portion of the supply chain cycle. In this, we have manufacturers and retailers that are buying products from manufacturers before being exposed to the general public/consumers.

In short, this contract is in the realm of supply chain smart contracts, but it will be limited to the relationship between manufacturers that are delivering and charging for certain products and retailers that will be paying for the shipments and keeping track of their orders.

Additionally, with each restock, there are batch numbers associated with it.

All in all, we are keeping track of one product currently in inventory, orders, and batches (where a new patch is the restock of the product).
